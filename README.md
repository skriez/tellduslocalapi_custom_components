Work is based on `tellduslive` component by `@molobrakos`.

What is it
==========

This is a hacked-together proof-of-concept that you can bypass the Telldus Live! service and rely upon the Local API published by the TellStick instead. It required very few changes to the original component, the changes basically amounting to modifying setup slightly and then rewriting the authentication.

Documentation of Local API is found at http://api.telldus.net/localapi/api.html

Tested with Hassio and Telldus TellStick ZNet Lite v2
